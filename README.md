# Pre_Free(Predicting health risks for Pregnant Patient)

Nowadays machine learning has been increasingly used in health care, prediction, diagnosis , and as a method of determining priority. 
Here by using the applicability and performance of machine learning methods this model will be used to identify pregnancy complications. 
The dataset used here consists data of from 1014 patients who have consented to share data such as age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose levels, body temperature, and finally, the model will predict risk levels or complications in the pregnancy and will classify the patients with a low, medium or high risk of having pregnancy complications. 
In such a scenario, the pregnancy-related risks can be reduced by forecasting the complications and by taking preventive measures. Thus, the use of predictive modeling became emergent to save the lives of millions of mothers and infants. 





## Motivation

1. The motivation was to experiment with end to end machine learning project and get some idea about deployment platform like Streamlit.
2. The main objective of this project is to identify the high-risk pregnancy which is a pregnancy complicated by a disease or disorder that may endanger life, or affect the health of the mother, the fetus, or the newborn.
3. The main objective is to provide right care at the right time at the right time to the patient.This personalized patient-centered care will lead to smart resource allocation and patient empowerment. 
## Features
* Nowadays machine learning has been increasingly used in health care, prediction, diagnosis , and as a method of determining priority. 
* Here by using the applicability and performance of machine learning methods this model will be used to identify pregnancy complications. 
* The dataset used here consists data of from 1014 patients who have consented to share data such as:
    1. Age
    2. Systolic blood pressure
    3. Diastolic blood pressure
    4. Heart rate
    5. Blood glucose levels
    6. Body temperature
* The model will predict risk levels or complications in the pregnancy and will classify the patients with a low, medium or high risk of having pregnancy complications.

* In such a scenario, the pregnancy-related risks can be reduced by forecasting the complications and by taking preventive measures. Thus, the use of predictive modeling became emergent to save the lives of millions of mothers and infants
## Methodologies used:
    1. Data gathering
    2. Descriptive Analysis
    3. Data Visualizations
    4. Data preprocessing 
    5. Data Modelling
    6. Model Evaluation 
    7. Model Deployment


## Deployment 
 # Streamlit

1. Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. 
2. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time.
3.  It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc 
4. To install Streamlit on Windows,  first install Anaconda  because according to the Streamlit documentation, Streamlit’s officially supported environment manager on Windows is Anaconda Navigator.
